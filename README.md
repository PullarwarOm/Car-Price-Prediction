# Car-Price-Prediction
- ML models made to predict car prices.
Aim - To make a Machine Learning model that can give an estimated selling price of a car based on some variables.

Description - Here, In this project, I made multiple Machine Learning models that can predict the prices of a car based on some variables. 
ML models - Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boost
Then I evaluated all the models on MAE and r2_score and I concluded which model is performing well.

Below is the sequential order of task I carried out in this project.
1. Data Loading
2. Missing value treatment
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Outlier Detection and handling
5. Data Preprocessing
6. Model Building
7. Model evaluation
8. Conclusion

Conclusion - This will help any car-selling company to get an estimated price of a car based on some variables. 

Skilled developed: Model training, model evaluation, preprocessing, cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Python, and Data handling.
