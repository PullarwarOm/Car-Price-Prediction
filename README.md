# Car-Price-Prediction
- ML models made to predict car prices.
- The dataset contains information about used cars.
- It has features like engine, bhp, mileage, fuel, year, transmission, etc
- The jupyter notebook contains the systematic approach to solve this kind of task where we have to build multiple machine learning models and then select the best models that can be used to predict the target variable. 
- You will find my inferences for almost every cell present in the notebook.
- I have performed various tasks like, data cleaning, data preprocessing, EDA, model building, model training, model evaluation, model comparing.
